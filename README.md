# SmartMeter NOE API

SmartMeter is an Austrian(Lower Austria) online platform for seeing the powerconsumtion for private people and small companyes that have the newer energy meter installed in there home/company

Link for the SmartMeter: https://smartmeter.netz-noe.at/

It was made by the Niederösterreichische Netz or short EVN Group you can get more infos by visiting them under following links: 
* https://www.netz-noe.at/ (Powernetwork Lower Austria)
* https://www.evn.at/ (Energieversorgung Niederösterreich - Powerprovider for Lower Austira) 

They dont provide any way to access personal data via any API except for the online platform
Some people find it really bad that they have to go to there browser goto smartmeter.netz-noe.at; log in; etc.

So because I want to combine it with a photovoltaik I decided to start this project and share it online.
